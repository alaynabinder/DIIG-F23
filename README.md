# DIIG-F23

The DIIG Data Division empowers clients to achieve their maximum potential by providing data-driven solutions to their business questions. My team partnered with a local startup focused on minimizing burnout amongst healthcare workers.

I developed an Instagram bot classification model using a neural network in Python to help optimize our client’s target user audience. Part of this included extracting 225,000+ data points from out client’s 7,759 Instagram followers using web scraping techniques.
